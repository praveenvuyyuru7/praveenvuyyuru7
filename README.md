Hi there! 👋
I'm Praveen Vuyyuru, a software enthusiast with a keen interest in Python programming and AI/ML applications. Here's a bit about me:

👀 I’m interested in exploring Python programming for developing AI and ML applications.
🌱 I’m currently diving deep into machine learning algorithms and techniques using Python libraries like TensorFlow and scikit-learn.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to AI/ML, whether it's building predictive models, natural language processing, computer vision, or any other exciting applications.
📫 You can reach me via email at praveenvuyyuru4@gmail.com.
